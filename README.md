## Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ferenc Huri

I graduated from the University of Szeged with a BSc degree in Computer Science in 2024, and since then I have been working as a software developer.

I have been working with programming since 2013, gaining practical experience in various programming languages and technologies, supporting the end-to-end process from digesting the user requirements into functional specifications, designing, validation testing, deploying and hypercaring the desired solution for the customer.

In the course of my previous work I have considered it important to work accurately, precisely, and to focus on customer-centric work. Good teamwork is essential to me. Thanks to my ability to integrate, my relationship with my colleagues was always good. To my work I'm loyal and with my knowledge I'm involved in the achievement of the set goals. In any situation I can find a solution and handle it properly. For my clients, I am always patient, understanding and helpful, and I have performed them with the utmost care and precision.
